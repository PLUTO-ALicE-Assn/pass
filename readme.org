#+TITLE: Pass

a file transfer tool.
point to point, no server needed.

* Build

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ pass <file-path> <port>

serving <file-name> on <address:port>
file name(not path) cannot exceed 512 characters
keyboard interrupt to kill
#+END_SRC

As prompt says, file name(not path) cannot exceed 512 characters.

Open a downloaded or web browser and go to <address:port>.

* Safety

TCP socket is used  so there is no encryption.


* P.S.
https://github.com/kern/filepizza got a fun cartoon.
