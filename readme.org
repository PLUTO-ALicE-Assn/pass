#+TITLE: Pass

a file transfer tool.
point to point, no server needed.
NAT traversal equipped.

* Build
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/PLUTO-ALicE-Assn/pass.git -b stable
cd pass
make
# copy to /usr/local/bin
# use sudo on linux
make install
#+END_SRC

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# map for port mapping if you don't have public ip address
$ pass <file-path> <port> (optional) map
#+END_SRC

File name(not path) cannot exceed 512 characters.

Open a downloaded or web browser and go to <address:port>.

* About port mapping

Currently pass can lmap port on only home NAT,
traversing Large-scale-NAT requires PCP protocol support.

pass will try to ise ipv6 be default,
so if you have ipv6 address don't map address.

* Safety

There is no encryption so don't use this on any secret.
